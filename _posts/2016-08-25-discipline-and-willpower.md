Discipline and Willpower

From what I can tell, discipline and willpower don't actually exist. 

It seems to me that the way we perceive them is by recognizing the lack of it in ourselves or others. It depends on comparing 2 people to eachother, both apparently of similar capabilities, one accomplishing a goal, and one not. To the one that is successful, it felt like work that they had to push through, which is true, but is incomplete. What is missing from the picture is that the successful one had some intrinsic motivation that powered them through to success, and that intrinsic motivation had nothing to do with discipline nor willpower.

So, when the unsuccessful one comes along and makes the attempt, they fail. Not because they are lazy, but because their intrinsic motivations are different.

This informs me of a recipe for success: pick goals that are aligned with our intrinsic motivations. How do we know what they are? They are already powering our actions now. Take a look at what you are doing now, and figure out what feeling you get from it.
