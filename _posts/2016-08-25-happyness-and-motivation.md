Happyness and Motivation

There's new research that suggests that when we are happy, we do things that we imagine will make us feel better when it is done, and when we are not happy, we do things that make us feel better now. 

I experience this when I'm down and find myself avoiding the things I know I need to do and kill time playing a game or watching tv. Or when I'm feeling good, and the urge to do some of those same tasks I previously avoided suddenly comes over me.

I've been in jobs where I wasn't happy, but could never find the time to revise my resume and apply for new jobs. Or am in a job where I was happy, and it became clear to me that it's time to move on and I applied for that new job.

What this does is reframe procrastination and lazyness for me. What if what I'm actually doing when I'm being lazy is just trying to cope with my lousy mood?
