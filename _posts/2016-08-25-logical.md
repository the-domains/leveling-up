Logical?

We are not logical. How do I know this? Because if we were inherently logical, we wouldn't have to learn logic.

So if we aren't logical, how does our mind work? Our mind is associational, and symbolic. It works on metaphors and stories. Mood and attitude determines how we perceive and interpret our reality.

What does this mean to me? It means that discovering root cause, and the supposed reasons why we do what we do, are all dead ends. It's just creating more stories to explain the story we are currently telling.

I see some associations like this:

We are born, experiencing feeling good, and feeling bad. We get hungry, and that feels bad. We scream and yell and we get fed. Being fed feels good. Soon, we recognize mom. We see that mom feeds us. We see mom at the same time that we are feeling good because we are being fed. Our mind makes a connection, and now being with mom feels good.

Another way that we associate is: We hear a story that Joe on another continent was walking in the forest, and got attacked by a bear/lion/dragon. Now, when I'm walking in a forest, I'm looking for (and imagining that I can hear/smell/see) the bear/lion/dragon.
